Background story
       With the advancement of digital technology, banks have turned our hard earned cash into binary numbers stored on the internet. However, with the advanced copies of digital e-statements where monthly summaries are being automatically generated does not really help us to understand or view our spending habits. There are just too many ways we can spend our money, either by cash, Paylah!, i-Banking, weChat pay, EZlink, different credit card payments from different services. It is hard for us to track down each and single transaction.
